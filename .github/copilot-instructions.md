Use this file to track workspace-specific instructions for Copilot.

- [x] Verify copilot-instructions file exists.
- [x] Clarify Project Requirements — Nepal pothole app with map, media, voting, leaderboard, fix tracking.
- [x] Scaffold the Project — Next.js App Router via `npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*" --use-npm`.
- [x] Customize the Project — Added data layer, API routes, uploads, dashboard UI (map, leaderboard, forms). Supabase integration now powers persistence.
- [x] Install Required Extensions — No extra extensions requested.
- [x] Compile the Project — Verified with `npm run lint`.
- [x] Create and Run Task — Added `.vscode/tasks.json` with "npm: dev" and executed once.
- [ ] Launch the Project — Awaiting user confirmation before running `npm run dev` for debugging.
- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete — README refreshed and copilot instructions cleaned up.

## Execution Guidelines
- Track progress in this checklist and the separate TODO list before each major step.
- Keep explanations short; summarize command output instead of pasting everything.
- Work in the repo root unless directed otherwise and avoid creating extra folders.
- Only add placeholders when clearly labeled; keep generated assets purposeful.
- Install only the extensions mandated by setup info.
- Prefer tool-specific commands (e.g., create_and_run_task) over manual shell scripting when available.
- Task completion requires a successful scaffold, clean compile, updated README, and developer instructions for running the app.
